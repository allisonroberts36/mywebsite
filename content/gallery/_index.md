I'm a PhD graduate student at Emory University, where I study everything related to healthcare.  My dissertation focuses on how hospitals implement innovations, like weigh-loss surgery. I want to know how our "healthcare-is-a-business" model might incentivize profitable procedures, but not life-saving ones.  I also teach the Sociology of Health and Illness and an Introduction to Quantitative Theory and Methods lab section (conducted in R).

I was born and raised in Franklin, Tennessee. I graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2014, where I majored in sociology and creative writing.  In my free time, I love to hike, bike, and volunteer at a local equine therapy center: [Stride Ahead](www.strideahead.org).  I'm also the least-talented member of a volleyball team.
