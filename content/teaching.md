## Courses Taught

SOC230: Sociological Aspects of Health and Illness
Fall 2017, Summer 2018

My course taught students a variety of ways to consider health and illness: at an individual, institutional, or population level. Students were asked to design research projects aligning with one of these levels, as well as read current articles in the field.

See a sample [syllabus](/files/SOC230 Roberts Syllabus Fall 2017.pdf).
