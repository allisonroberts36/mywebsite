All of my work is dedicated to improving healthcare systems, particularly in the United States.  I am the co-President of the [Institute for Healthcare Improvement](ihi.org), Emory Chapter.  The organization offers free quality improvement training online through the [Open School](ihi.org/open_school), which I highly recommend.  They also have an annual leadership training at their National Headquarters in Boston, which I attended this summer. 
  We also coordinate with the [Health Innovation Program](http://hip.emory.edu/) at Emory, headed by Dr. Sanfilippo. With this program, we host a Student Networking Night, a Student Symposium on research, and other programs.  Check out the website for our current projects.
