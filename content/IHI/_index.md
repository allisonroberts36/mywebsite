All of my work is dedicated to improving healthcare systems, particularly in the United States.  I am a member of the [Institute for Healthcare Improvement](ihi.org).  The organization offers free quality improvement training online through the [Open School](ihi.org/open_school), which I highly recommend.  They also have an annual leadership training at their National Headquarters in Boston, which I attended this summer.
