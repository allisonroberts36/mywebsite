Achieving this required that we stay at the forefront of technology, which is why we are proud to be the first hospital in our region to have the latest in physician-assisted robotic surgical systems - the da Vinci® Xi.; If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with a condition that may require surgery, you owe it to yourself to learn about all of your medical options, including the most effective, least invasive surgical treatments available.; The da Vinci® Xi  Surgical System provides surgeons with an alternative to both traditional open surgery and conventional laparoscopy, putting a surgeon's hands at the controls of a state-of-the-art robotic platform.

Among your concerns is: \"Will my body function normally following surgery?\" Traditional open urologic surgery -- in which large incisions are made to access the pelvic organs -- has been the standard approach when surgery is warranted. Yet common drawbacks of this procedure include significant post-surgical pain, a lengthy recovery and an unpredictable, potentially long-term impact on continence and sexual function.; da Vinci  Surgery, a minimally invasive approach that utilizes the latest in surgical and robotics technologies, is ideal for delicate urologic surgery. This includes prostatectomy, in which the target site is not only tightly confined but also surrounded by nerves affecting urinary control and sexual function.; Traditional open gynecologic surgery, using a large incision for access to the uterus and surrounding anatomy, has for many years been the standard approach to many gynecologic procedures. Yet with open surgery can come significant pain, trauma, a long recovery process and threat to surrounding organs and nerves.; For complex hysterectomies and other gynecologic procedures, robot-assisted surgery with the da Vinci  Surgical System may be the most effective, least invasive treatment option. Through tiny, 1-2 cm incisions, surgeons using the da Vinci System can operate with greater precision and control, minimizing the pain and risk associated with large incisions while increasing the likelihood of a fast recovery and excellent clinical outcomes.; If you’ve been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, your physician may suggest surgery to remove part of your lung (lobe). The operation is called a lobectomy. It can be done using open surgery or minimally invasive surgery.; One minimally invasive surgery option is thoracoscopy, also called video-assisted thoracic surgery or VATS. Doctors insert a tiny camera and surgical instruments into your chest through small incisions. The camera sends images to a video screen to guide doctors as they operate.

Memorial Hospital was officially dedicated on Sunday, April 3, 1960, and opened its doors to receive patients the following day. The 80-bed hospital was built under the Hill-Burton Hospital Survey & Construction Act of 1946. The Hill-Burton Act initiated the concept of local, state, and federal cost sharing of healthcare facilities, and provided federal funds for construction and renovation of more than 9,000 medical facilities, particularly in lower income areas. While two-thirds of the money was provided by the Federal government and the State of Georgia, Memorial Hospital has always been operated by the Hospital Authority of the City of Bainbridge and Decatur County.; Prior to the opening of Memorial Hospital, two private hospitals served the healthcare needs of Decatur and surrounding counties. In 1916, Riverside Hospital was built and operated by Dr. J. D. Chason, Dr. Gordon Chason, Dr. R. F. Wheat, and Dr. Willie Lee Wilkinson. Shortly after the Riverside Hospital was built, Dr. A.E.B. Alford came to Bainbridge and built the Bainbridge Hospital. The Flint River provided easy access to these hospitals for people in rural areas and nearby towns, making Bainbridge a healthcare center for the tri-state area.  Memorial Hospital was given its name in memoriam to those pioneers who made Bainbridge the medical center of Southwest Georgia, Northern Florida, and Southeastern Alabama for many decades.; On Monday, April 4, 1960, Memorial Hospital admitted its first patient, Mr. Lee A. Parker, who was transferred from Riverside Hospital. On the same day, Mrs. Bennie (Jane) Ware gave birth to the hospital’s first baby, Cathy Ware. The second baby Jane Brock (Tye) was born on April 5, 1960, to Ernest and Edna Brock of Climax. The third baby was the first boy born in the new hospital. Charles Allen Wells, son of Mr. and Mrs. F. E. Wells. He was born on April 6. The first set of twins were born on May 12, 1960, Michael George and Mark James LaPointe. Their parents were Mr. and Mrs. R. N. LaPointe. Mr. LaPointe was an instructor at Southern Airways School. Since that time, there have been over 20,000 babies born at Memorial Hospital. The first year of operation resulted in 2,201 patients admitted and 338 babies delivered at Memorial Hospital. The average daily census in 1960 was 32.6 patients and the highest census was 53 patients. Since 1960, the physicians and employees at Memorial Hospital have treated over 450,000 people in the emergency department, provided care to over 147,000 inpatients, and birthed over 20,000 babies.; Members of the Hospital Authority who dedicated themselves to the planning and building of Memorial Hospital were Chairman C. M. Trulock, J. W. Hunt, Vice Chairman, J.M. Woodbury, Secretary, David Bryan, Treasurer, Raleigh Rollins, Graham Bolton, Kenneth Hodges, W. T. Laslie, Jimmie Wells and T. E. Smith. Frank L. Gibson, M.D., served as Medical Consultant for the new hospital.  The original medical staff of Memorial Hospital and Manor included Dr. R. F. Dickinson, Chief of Staff, Dr. Charles Bellville, Dr. Henry Bridges, Dr. Mortimer Ehrlich, Dr. Frank Gibson, Dr. Edwin Griffin, Dr. L. W. Willis, Sr., Dr. L. W. Willis, Jr., and Dr. Ashby Woods. Other physicians were Dr. J. J. Collins of Thomasville, the Radiologist, and Dr. Margaret W. Johnson, of Moultrie, the Pathologist. In the early days of Memorial Hospital, the emergency room was staffed by local physicians as needed. When emergencies occurred, physicians were called at their offices or homes to attend patients in the emergency room. It wasn’t until years later that Memorial Hospital had a 24-hour physician-staffed emergency room.; The hospital employed approximately 60 people when it first opened, including Administrator Vesper Paul Turnage, Mrs. Alburose “Abbie” Dollar, Administrative Secretary, Mrs. Eloise Monk, Medical Records Department, Mrs. Irene Toole, Supervisor of Nurses, Mrs. Vivian Cameron, R.T., Radiology; Harold Marshall, A.M.T., Laboratory, Mrs. Arylene Syer, R.N., Anesthetist, Mrs. Ruth Drawdy, A.D.A. Dietician, Mrs. Jean Anderson, Housekeeper, Robert D. Taylor, Engineer, and Mrs. Lillie Priest, Accountant.  As Memorial Hospital expanded its facilities and services through the years, the number of employees increased, as well. At the time of it’s 50th Anniversary, there were approximately 540 employees, 22 active staff physicians, 20 consulting staff physicians, and 75 volunteers.; Through the years, Memorial Hospital and Manor, an 80-bed acute care hospital, has expanded its facilities and services to meet the needs of a growing community.  In 1972, Memorial Manor, a 67-bed Long Term Care Facility, was built adjacent to the Hospital, and in 1979, Manor II was completed, adding another 40 beds to the nursing home. An Intensive Care Unit was added in 1986, a new Level II Emergency Department was built in 1993, and three new building projects were completed in 1998, including the Kirbo Women’s Center, Willow Ridge Personal Care Facility, and Memorial Medical Center. Renovation of patient rooms in the hospital and resident rooms in the Manor are an ongoing project at Memorial Hospital and Manor. Plans are being made for the construction of a new Same Day Surgery center at the hospital, which will include expanded facilities for the Laboratory, Radiology and other departments.; Under the leadership of the Hospital Authority of the City of Bainbridge and Decatur County, our facility continues to grow to meet the needs of Bainbridge, Decatur County and the surrounding communities.; Memorial Hospital, 1960; ; 1500 E. Shotwell Street; Bainbridge, GA 39819; 229-246-3500; info@mh-m.org","First Hospital; In 1914, Doctors Herman Dismuke and Gabe Willis, the first doctors in Ocilla, built and opened its first hospital, the Dismuke and Willis Sanitarium. According to the family that lives in the building now, the original hospital was a 20-bed facility.  The Sanitarium was located on Vo-Tech Road.  The building still stands today across from the old Irwin County High School campus, albeit without its prominent porches. It is now a private residence.; ; ; Second Hospital; Sometime during the early 1930’s, Dr. Willis built a new hospital in downtown Ocilla, on North Irwin Avenue.  Then, in November, 1935, Dr. Dismuke made plans to build his own hospital right next to Dr. Willis’ building.  The plan was for the two buildings to be connected by a passageway, although the buildings would be independent of each other.  The Dismuke hospital would also use the operating room of the Willis hospital.  In May, 1939, plans were made at that time to enlarge and modernize the Willis and Dismuke hospital, as it was known in 1939.  The two former buildings were merged into one by the addition of a section built in front of them both and connected with both.  The new additions increased the bed space at the time to 20 beds with an operating room, x-ray room, and laboratories to meet the needs of a modern hospital.  The building is still in use today as the Irwin County Department of Family and Children Services.; ; Third Hospital; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; In 1953, Irwin County’s newest hospital facility was constructed on North Irwin Avenue, using prison labor.  The hospital had 34 beds.  The hospital authority formed at that time was made up of four members:  Charles A. Harris, Chairman; Harris Dill, Sr., Vice Chairman; Murphey Rogers, Secretary-Treasurer;, and W. O. Wingate, Jr.  The physician roster included Dr. Herman Dismuke, Dr. Tom Little, Dr. W. C. Sams, and Dr. G. W. Willis.   The building remained as is until 1996, when under the new management of MGA Health Management, Inc., and a commitment to provide the highest quality patient care, renovations and construction of a new addition to the facility got underway.  A new wing was built onto the existing hospital.  Once completed, the hospital could boast of a nursery, operating room suites, Lab, x-ray room, Respiratory room, two new surgical suites, new admissions area, new emergency room, and many other areas.   The hospital is still being utilized today, and the current management continues to make improvements to the hospital to provide the best medical care possible for its patients.; ","","We are committed to delivering healthcare as it should be: patient-centered and for the good of all people, no matter their circumstance.
